\Abstract{
The TW Hydrae association is a group of about 30 very young stars located 50 pc from Earth
 that are 5-10 million years old. The best studied members of this stellar association are TW Hydrae 
(nearest known accreting T Tauri star to the Earth), HR 4796 (an A-type star with resolved dusty debris disk; the most massive known group member), 
HD 98800 (a quadruple star system with debris disk), and 2M1207 (accreting brown dwarf with remarkable planetary-mass companion 2M1207b).
This ˜25 MJup brown dwarf(2M1207), located ˜70 pc from Earth, has been recently identified as a member of the TW Hydrae Association (age ˜ 8 Myr). 
Astrometry and photometry in the H, Ks and L' bands and upper limit in J-band reveal a very red object(2M1207b) at a close separation of ˜780 mas (˜55 AU)
with a spectral type L5-L9.5.  
Different evolutionary models predict an object within the planetary regime with a mass of M=5$\pm$2 MJup and an effective temperature of 
Teff=1250$\pm$200 K

%%%%% THE TWO PAGES OF THE SCIENTIFIC DESCRIPTION AND FIGURES %%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%---- BOX 7 ------------------------------------------------------------
%
%               THIS DESCRIPTION IS RESTRICTED TO TWO PAGES 
%
%   THE RELATIVE LENGTHS OF EACH OF THESE SECTIONS ARE VARIABLE,
%   BUT THEIR SUM (INCLUDING FIGURES & REFS.) IS RESTRICTED TO TWO PAGES
%
% All macros in this box are NOT checked at the pdfLaTeX compilation.

\ScientificRationale{
We already have a few photometric and astrometric results  from Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) in bands: J , H , Ks 
(The transformations between the two filters Ks and K were found smaller than the measuring errors.) and from Keck telescope in L' band 

The parent dwarf appears to be of spectral type M8 with magnitudes: 13.00(J), 12.39(H), 11.95(K), 11.38 (L') and the
giant planet candidate: spectral type L5 - L9.5 with magnitudes: $\ge$ 18.5(J),  18.09 (K), 16.93(K), 15.28(L') 

}

\ImmediateObjective{It is not established yet the nature of the companion of the brown dwarf that we believe is a giant planet. 
We need to repeat the photometric  measurements using adaptive optics infrared wavefront sensing to acquire sharp images and to obtain  spectroscopic results. 
If we can confirm the belief that the companion is a giant planet these would be the first images of an exoplanet.}

%
%---- THE SECOND PAGE OF THE SCIENCE CASE CAN INCLUDE FIGURES ----------
%
% Up to ONE page of figures can be added to your proposal.
% The text and figures of the scientific description must not
% exceed TWO pages in total.
% If you use color figures, do make sure that they are still readable
% if printed in black and white. Figures must be in PDF or JPEG format.

%
%---- BOX 8 ------------------------------------------------------------
%
% Provide below a careful justification of the requested lunar phase
% and of the requested number of nights or hours.  
% All macros in this box are NOT checked at the pdfLaTeX compilation.

\WhyLunarPhase{
The object we want to observe is very faint
}  

\WhyNights{
We need images in band J, H, Ks and L' and specter of the object with upper limit estimated magnitude $\approx$ 20 in band J;
ETC gave us NDIT = 9 (J), NDIT = 1 (H, Ks and L') and NDIT = 120(specter) for DIT = 20s 
making a total time 2640s (we estimated to 1 h with overheads)  

}

\TelescopeJustification{

VLT is the world's most advanced optical instrument, consisting of four Unit Telescopes with main mirrors of 8.2m diameter and four movable 1.8m diameter Auxiliary Telescopes. 
We want to use  UT1 beacuse we want to use intrument NACO.

NACO = Nasmyth Adaptive Optics System (NAOS) + Near-Infrared Imager and Spectrograph (CONICA)

NACO has been contributing to major discoveries in different fields of astronomy: exoplanets, the Galactic centre of the Milky Way, young stellar objects, Solar System bodies, etc.

\DDTJustification{The only option was for cycle 96z(DDT cycle) }

\LastObservationRemark{
September 2003, VLT(UT3) telescope with instrument ISAAC at Nasmyth A focus:
Spectroscopic surveys of large numbers of young low-mass stars which are still deeply embedded in their parental clouds. 
Our infrared spectra show a rich variety of features due to ices and gas-phase molecules, each of which
trace different aspects of the physical and chemical state of the objects.

We already published the data:
Origin and Evolution of Ices in star-forming regions a VLT-ISAAC 3–5 $\mu m$  spectroscopic survey

\RequestedDuplicateRemark{
There are some results from 2 mass survey that our research is based on. We want to repeat the observations in  J, H, Ks and L' band
using adaptative optics and  a bigger integration time and to obtain its specter in order to determine the nature of the companion of the brown dwarf 
that appears faintly in the images from 2 mass.

% For AT observations, please specify only one of the 3
