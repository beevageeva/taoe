\Abstract{
The TW Hydrae association is a group of about 30 very young stars located 50 pc from Earth
 that are 5-10 million years old. The best studied members of this stellar association are TW Hydrae 
(nearest known accreting T Tauri star to the Earth), HR 4796 (an A-type star with resolved dusty debris disk; the most massive known group member), 
HD 98800 (a quadruple star system with debris disk) and 2M1207 (accreting brown dwarf with spectral type M8 
of mass $\approx$25MJup and $\approx$8Myr age located $\approx$70 pc from Earth with a remarkable planetary-mass companion 2M1207b: 
a very red object at a close separation of $\approx$780 mas ($\approx$55 AU) with a spectral type L5-L9.5).
Different evolutionary models predict for the companion an object within the planetary regime with a mass of M=5$\pm$2 MJup 
and an effective temperature Teff=1250$\pm$200 K. The fact that the companion is a planet as well as the TW hydraee membership is still disputed and is the reason of our proposal.

\ScientificRationale{
We already have a few photometric and astrometric results  from Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) in bands: J , H , Ks 
(The transformations between the two filters Ks and K were found smaller than the measuring errors.) and from Keck telescope in L' band 

The parent dwarf appears to be of spectral type M8 with magnitudes: 13.00(J), 12.39(H), 11.95(K), 11.38 (L') and the
giant planet candidate: spectral type L5 - L9.5 with magnitudes: $\ge$ 18.5(J),  18.09 (H), 16.93(K), 15.28(L') 
(These values were obtained by comparison of its photometry with the infrared colors
of field late-M, L and T dwarfs obtained by Leggett et al.
(2001, 2002), Stephens et al. (2001), Golimowski et al. (2004)
and Knapp et al. (2004) as seen in Fig 2)

We believe that \textbf{the parent dwarf is part of TW Hydrae association} first by observing its proper motion. 
The specter of the parent dwarf has   already been measured and the radial velocity deduced  from it is also consistent with the 
TW Hydrae membership. 
NaI absortion line at 8200 A which indicates low  surface gravity and H$\alpha$ emission line indicate a very young object.
From isochrone fitting in the HR diagram we estimate its age to 10Myr and this is  in concordance with the TW hydrae membership

It is not established yet the nature of the companion of the brown dwarf that we believe is a \textbf{giant planet}.
Contamination by a foreground or background field L dwarf is still possible, though very improbable.
 The companion IR colors are consistent
with that observed by Leggett et al. (2002) for late L field
dwarfs, age of 1−5 Gyr; for example, an L8 field dwarf located
at $\approx$ 60 pc or L5 field dwarf at $\approx$ 130 pc.
Based on a number density of L dwarfs of $1.9 \times 10^{-3}/ pc^{3}$
given by Burgasser (2001) and Cruz et al. (2003), the probability
of finding a foreground or background L dwarf (located
between 50 and 150 pc) in a region of 780 mas radius around
2M1207 is equal to $9 \times 10^{-8}$. Consequently, contamination by
an L field dwarf is very improbable.

The  signs of accretion onto the young dwarf:
 various He I and H I emission lines (Mohanty
et al. 2003; Gizis 2002) and the $H\alpha$ line which is asymmetric and
broad are also supporting the idea. Although L
-band observations of
Jayawardhana et al. (2003) did not reveal significant IR excess
at 3.8 µm, recent mid-IR observations of Sterzik et al. (2004,
accepted) found excess emission at 8.7 µm and 10.4 µm and
confirm disk accretion as the likely cause of the strong activity.
New Chandra observations of Gizis \& Bharat (2004) corroborates
this disk-accretion scenario as they suggest that less
than 20\% of the H$\alpha$ emission can be due to chromospheric activity.


We already used estimated age and distance and the measured magnitudes of the companion with evolutionary models which 
predict for the companion a mass M=5$\pm$2 MJup 
and an effective temperature Teff=1250$\pm$200 K which are appropriate for a giant planet.
We used  the non gray model of Burrows et al. (1997),
for a distance of 70 pc and age of $\approx$ 5−10 Myr  and we obtained a mass
of 3 - 10 MJup and Teff 1000 - 1600 K, but we considered afterwards new generation models: the DUSTY
and COND models. These can be seen as two extreme cases, to describe
respectively brown dwarfs with an atmosphere saturated
in dust, like late M and L dwarfs, and cool brown dwarfs or
giant planets with the dust condensed in their atmosphere, like
T dwarfs. We estimate the effective temperature and the  mass of the companion by using the different color - magnitude diagrams using
H, K and L bands or using the measured bolometric corrections
$BC_K \approx 3.2$  for late-L dwarfs estimated by Golimowski
et al. (2004) 

}

\ImmediateObjective{
The red object so close: at $\approx780$ mas from the brown dwarf is very intriguing.
 
We need to repeat the photometric  measurements using adaptive optics infrared wavefront sensing to acquire sharp images with bigger
integration time and to obtain  spectroscopic results (of the companion).

Spectroscopy reveals information about the atmosphere: whether the object is a candidate to support life. 
We can also estimate radial velocities.

More accurate photometry and spectroscopic results are better input parameters for evolutionary models which might not be very precise 
beacuse of the very young age.
 
If we can confirm the belief that the companion is a planet these would be \textbf{the first images of an exoplanet}.

We also want to confirm that \textbf{the brown dwarf is a member of TW Hydrae association}.

(used for high intensity background)
we set DIT to 30s

we get for input S/N = 13 NDIT = 8



For \textbf{band H} the same as for band J, we change the seeing (more easily achieved for longer wavelengths):
to 0.60 arcsec and for an input S/N = 200 we get NDIT =      16


For \textbf{Band Ks} same as band H , but with an input S/N = 340           NDIT =       16
 

For \textbf{Band L'}:
same as band Ks, we change NAOS Dichroic                         : JHK,
Detector read-out mode                : Uncorr(HighWellDepth) (read-out noise 60.00 e-),
we set DIT to 0.175s  and obtain for input S/N = 100 NDIT =     1312

Detector read-out mode        : FowlerNsamp(HighSensitivity),
 We set DIT = 300s and for S/N = 10 we get NDIT = 9
So we have total time 1430s  (imaging) + 2700s (specter) = 4130s calculated without overheads we round it to 1.5h

\TelescopeJustification{

VLT is the world's most advanced optical instrument, consisting of four Unit Telescopes with main mirrors of 8.2m diameter and four movable 1.8m diameter Auxiliary Telescopes. 
We want to use  UT1 beacuse we want to use intrument NACO.

NACO = Nasmyth Adaptive Optics System (NAOS) + Near-Infrared Imager and Spectrograph (CONICA)

NACO has been contributing to major discoveries in different fields of astronomy: exoplanets, the Galactic centre of the Milky Way, young stellar objects, Solar System bodies, etc.

In order to split the beam for the adaptive optics we use the N90C10 dichroic (90\% flux to the wavefront sensor  of NAOS and 10\% to the camera 
CONICA) for imaging in J, H and Ks band and for spectrography. 
This mode is dedicated to the sharp imaging of red sources V − K $\ge$ 6 (M5 or later spectral type), but this cannot 
be used for  L' filter where we use  the JHK dichroic(90\% flux to the WFS and 90\% to 
CONICA).

\TargetNotes{RA above  given in h:m:s format and declination in d:m:s format and the magnitude are those of the parent brown dwarf(2M1207). 
We use as reference star for adaptive optics  
the parent brown dwarf  because the Adaptive Optics System (NAOS) is designed to work with natural guide stars.
The target(the companion) is slightly off the optical axis because the parent dwarf is used as reference source(the image is centered in the parent dwarf). 
This is particularly useful if the target is very faint.
A reference image obtained from 2 mass (centered on the parent dwarf) is shown in Fig. 1
For spectroscopy we observe simultaneously the parent dwarf and its companion(2M1207b) at coordinates: RA: 12h:07m:34.01s, dec: -39d:32m:58.9s

% 8th parameter: Range of visibilities for the specified configuration.
% Please specify the maximum and minimum visibility values
% corresponding to the chosen configuration at hour angle 0
% separated by "/".
